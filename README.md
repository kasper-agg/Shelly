This repository is in the first place a personal project.
It suits very specific needs (mine).

But, I hope my scripts, struggles and solutions might inspire and help others.

I statert with one Shelly Plug S Gen3. I wanted to know 
how much power my devices were consuming.
With that came the need for Home Assistant.
After a while, more plugs were installed, including two 
Shelly 1PM Gen4 (they have higher amp rating for some heavier devices)
and a HomeWizard P1 meter.

I don't have any experience with other brands or solutions, 
but I must say I really like the Shelly products and Home Assistant.

The default out of the box automations provided by Shelly and Home Assistant work fine
for our outdoor lights or to automatically shut power off after a certain time of usage.
Think deep fryer. You really don't want to accidentally forget to unplug one.

Anyway, I stumbled upon an automation which I could not create without scripting.

So here we are. A repo, a Readme and a script.
